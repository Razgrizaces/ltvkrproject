Hi all, welcome to the LTV Korean Project. 

This was created with the idea to teach beginners with a solid foundation or intermediate Korean Learners some words or  from Loona TVs. It's very similar to using a drama, webdrama, movie or TV series, but LOONA uses a lot of langauge and things that I've found are used every day, and at over 8 hours of content, ther's a lot to learn from. There still are so many LTVS I need to sub, and there's still a lot of things I need to work on, so please post in the Issues if you would like to help me translate, or if you have an issue with the translations.

I created this by myself in JS and Python, using Bootstrap 4, JQuery, and Pandas. The translations I've done are from my own knowledge, from Naver's English-Korean Dictionary, or from Talk to Me in Korean (some grammar points).
