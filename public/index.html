		<h1>LTV Korean Project</h1>
		<p>Currently a WIP. I'm creating this project to try to help other Korean learners who are in the same place as me, who like LOONA and want to try to learn Korean through the amount of subtitled content that LOONA has. I apologize but if you're looking to learn korean from the beginning this is not the place. I recommend something like Talk to Me in Korean or How to Study Korean to get you the basics. This is for intermediate learners who have learned the basics of Korean and want to add some more vocabulary to their list. I've also added the most common words and expressions so if you would like to see those then please click the link titled Analysis. Most of the translations come from Naver dictionary, from the LTVs themselves, or from my own experience, but if you feel they are wrong please feel free to correct me! You can post an issue at the icon below if you have a better translation or if you have any suggestions with the site. </p>
		<p>There still is a lot to be done, so if you would like to help me translate please let me know! You can get in touch with me at the link below, or find my discord as razgrizaces#6969. </p>
